# Zettelread
An app for displaying [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). Written in [Cordova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cordova). Tested only with Android 10, though probably works with other systems too.

## Zettelkästen format
Since I made the app for personal usage, it's not very flexible. It supports only one way of structuring your Zettelkästen
```md
# The first line for the title
#the #second #one #for #tags

In the third and next lines you can write anything, since it doesn't get displayed anyway.
```
